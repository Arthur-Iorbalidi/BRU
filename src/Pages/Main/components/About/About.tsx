      <p>
        React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called
        components. Create your own React components like Thumbnail, LikeButton,
        and Video. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you work on your own or with thousands of other developers,
        using React feels the same. It is designed to let you seamlessly combine
        components written by independent people, teams, and organizations.
